      <h1>Nathan Sykes</h1>
      <p>Not once have we had such a situation in our lives when we loved some artists' voice so much but when we heard them live, the magic was gone. If you're tired of such disappointments you definately should listen to 23-year old singer Nathan Sykes. He was previusly in a band called <i>The Wanted</i> and their career was for sure one big success. The band consisted of five boys from the UK but after few years <i>The Wanted</i> decided to split up. Every member found his own path but fortunetly Nathan kept singing and after one year break, he presented a single called <i>„More than you'll ever know”</i> to us. Fans of <i>The Wanted</i> went insane. They were happy that he came back.</p>
      <p>First of all, all fans were surprised that Sykes' voice has changed so much during just one year! He sounded more mature and few months later he released next single called <i>„Kiss me quick”</i>. Soon Nathan released a music video to a song called <i>„Over and over again”</i>. He made a short tour around the UK and in December 2015 Nathan performed on <i>Jingle Bell Ball</i> music festival in London in front of 16,000 people! That was the greatest moment in his solo career. I had the pleasure of seeing him there. It was incredible to see Nathan live as I never had a chance of seeing <i>The Wanted</i> on stage. Nathan was always my favourite member and I was so glad to see him that night. Everyone was surprised by how Nathan sang his songs and I couldn't believe my ears. Live, he sounds so much better than on the Internet videos on YouTube. You definately should listen to him.</p>
      <p>At the beggining of December 2016 Nathan released his debut album <i>„Unfinished Business”</i> which received great opinions and feedback. He was also touring with Little Mix as the support act.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Nathan isn't famous here in Poland but I'm here to present him to you. What are you waiting for? Go and listen to some songs! Hope you'll like them :)</p>

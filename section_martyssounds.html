      <h1>Waterparks</h1>
      <p>
        Nice name for a band, isn't it? Well, <i>Waterparks</i> have nothing to do with actual water park
        but they're really worth the attention. <i>Waterparks</i> are from the USA,
        Houston and their career started in 2001. At first, they got the attention in the USA
        but soon fans from Europe found them on the Internet and suddenly the band gained more fans.
        <i>Waterparks</i> became known better when they presented the world with a music video
        for their song called <i>„Crave”</i>. The music video for that song is quite controversial,
        as the band members - Awsten, Geoff and Otto are kissing dogs.
        That's quite weird but is there something people wouldn't to be famous?
        Waterparks released three EP's and soon started working on new music.
        The next song which caught people's attention was <i>„Royal”</i>.
        It's a catchy song and it's the most recognisable song after <i>„Crave”</i>.
        Last year Waterparks released their debut album called <i>„Double Dare”</i>.
        In March 2017 they were the support act of <i>All Time Low</i> in their European leg of tour.
        Unfortunately, the band haven't visited Poland yet but let's hope that one day they will come here.
        In September 2017 <i>Waterparks</i> went on their next European Tour (most dates were in UK)
        and it was a huge success. The sold out shows are the reason to come back here soon.
        I'm sure they will get more attention soon, so keep up to date, guys!
      </p>
      <p>Here I present you some of their songs. Enjoy and see you next month!</p>

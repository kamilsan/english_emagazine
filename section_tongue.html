      <h1>Methods of learning a language</h1>
      <p>Finding a studying method that's perfect for you might be a long way full of frustration. Still, the
         results will be worth it! You'll be able to memorise vocabulary and grammar won't seem so hard.</p>
      <p>Here are some of studying methods that work for a lot of people:</p>
      <b><p>1. Naming everything around you</p></b>
      <p>During your walk to school, dinner or shopping with a family, always try to name objects from your
         surroundings in a language that you're learning. Dictionary, cushion, headphones... But what's that?
         Quick, grab a paper sheet and the dictionary! "<i>Pouf</i>"? Congratulations, now you know a new word.</p>
      <b><p>2. Watch films and TV series*</p></b>
      <p>Voice-over, dubbing or Polish subtitles? None of them will help you learn a language! Find English
         films with English subtitles, or, if you're more advanced, English films without any subtitles. It helps
         you with getting used to vocabulary (including slang), grammatical structures and pronunciation.</p>
      <p class="annotation">*If you're a beginner, don't be shy and watch kid cartoons. Peppa Pig will teach you how to speak
         English and oink properly. ;)</p>
      <b><p>3. Translating song lyrics</p></b>
      <p> You're a music freak who'd like to sit down and study, but the new album of your favourite band is
          just marvellous and distracting? Don't worry, just combine listening with trying to understand the
          lyrics, pay attention to the pronunciation and translate the song! From now on, if your parents tell
          you to turn down the volume, you'll have the best excuse ever - studying!</p>

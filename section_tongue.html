      <h1>Methods of learning a language pt. II</h1>
      <p><b>1. Naming everything around you</b></p>
      <p>
        You're a beginner? Start reading books for children (<i>"Little Red Riding Hood"</i> is always on fire, remember that!). You're on intermediate level? <i>"Harry Potter"</i> may be a way to go!* You are a Yoda of the English language? Try <i>"The War of the Worlds"</i> or <i>"The Picture of Dorian Gray"</i>!**
      </p>

        *WARNING! An evitable urge to fly on brooms will occur!</br>
        **WARNING! Historical grammar will occur!
      </p>
      <p><b>2. Playing video games/watching playthroughs</b></p>
      <p>
        Are you not much of a bookworm, but you're still a geek and you'd like fun and learning to intermingle? How about you play some video game then? More often than not, you can turn subtitles on, so why not take advantage of it? If you don't have any accessory to play video games yourself, there are dozens of playthroughs on YouTube - you can find ones with or without subtitles.
      </p>
      <p><b>3. Talking with Polish-speaking friends in English</b></p>
      <p>
        Think it'd be awkward? Maybe at first, but remember - you both want to learn and you're determined to do it, plus speaking with your Polish friends in English will be a great preparation to speaking with foreigners, whose knowledge of your mother tongue will be limited to "Dzie≈Ñ dobry". Gain some confidence and start conquering the world!

      <p><b><i>Remember - the key to efficient learning is FUN!</i></b></p>

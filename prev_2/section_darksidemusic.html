      <p>
        Have you ever thought how would a combination of music and passion for travelling look like?
        If yes, then you are at the right place with the right attitude to kick off the extraordinary voyage.
        As you have all probably guessed by now today I am going to introduce you to the figure of Quebonafide
        and his upcoming album called <i>"Egzotyka"</i>.

        This project is something that our Polish rap scene has not yet experienced, however it does not mean,
        than we are not ready for it.
        Actually we are and all that really is required here is an open mind and a will to widen and expand your horizons.

        The main concept of this CD revolves around travelling to the most exotic and remote countries all over the world,
        living there, getting to know local people,
        their culture and habits but above all the most important aim of this venture is to show what people struggle with,
        obstacles they need to avoid during their lives,
        to portray the puberty and to confront the reality with the perception of a typical person.
        All these matters mentioned above can be easily featured in a music album like this one.
        The rapper from Ciechanów does a great job at putting the emotions and his message across.
        Even though he is only 25 years old you can certainly notice,
        that he is a great observer and spots even the tiniest features of the people he meets throughout his trip.

        So far the Polish artist has visited seven completely different countries: Thailand, Mexico, Dubai, India,
        Sri Lanka, Madagascar and Brazil. Each land is represented by a particular track.
        Every song has its own vibe and style often relating to country’s history, music and traditions.

        Summarizing, if you are eager to take part in an amazing tour without leaving your lovely nest and you are a
        sucker for modern rap full of wordplay and larded with feelings then this album will surely appeal to you and
        will most likely end up on a high spot of your top CDs of all time.
        All you need to do now is to patiently wait for the pre-order to launch and hope, that the five unrevealed yet
        tracks will be even more stunning and charming.

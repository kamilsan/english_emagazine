      <p>Alberto Ascari was 1952 &amp; 1953 F1 World Champion.</p>
      <p>He had connections with motorsport since the beginning of his life – his father, Antonio raced for the
        Alfa Romeo team in 1920s, until his death in French GP in 1925. Despite that, 7 year old Alberto
        decided to be a racing driver, just like his dad. His mum sent him to the boarding school twice so that
        her son would stop racing, but each time Alberto escaped in order to come back to his home in
        Milan, near the famous Monza track.</p>
      <p>Formula 1 officially started in 1950. Ascari joined Enzo Ferrari’s team. In the first season he finished 5th, in 1951 he came second.</p>
      <p>1952 and 1953 were his best years – he won 7 races in a row – 9 if we take out the Indy 500 – the
        race in which none of F1 drivers decided to start (a record which remain untied until 2013, when
        Sebastian Vettel also won 9 races in a row).</p>
      <p>In 1954 he joined newly formed Lancia team. The car was vulnerable to defects, so Ascari’s results
        were nowhere near his earlier ones.</p>
      <p>In 1955 Monaco GP Ascari had famous accident – he dropped out of the track and flew into the sea.
        Luckily for him, the worst injury he sustained was the broken nose. His lucky blue helmet was
        destroyed as well.</p>
      <p>Few days later Alberto and his friend Eugenio Castellotti went to Monza track. Ascari came to the
        track as a spectator but for some reason, he decided to drive as well. On the third lap he lost the
        control over the car, somersaulted and died due to sustained fatal injuries. Nowadays, this turn is
        named after Ascari.</p>
      <p>Did I mentioned how superstitious Ascari was? The coincidences are even more unbelievable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During his whole life, he was afraid of dying at the same age as his dad – he died being 4 days older.</li>
        <li>Alberto died on the 26th of May, Antonio on the 26th of July.</li>
        <li>It was the only time when he didn’t wear the lucky blue helmet.</li>
        <li>They both died in similar circumstances – during the fast left-hander.</li>
        <li>Each of them bereaved wife and two children.</li>
        <li>Both father and son died 4 days after serious incidents.</li>
        <li>Only other driver who crashed into the sea in Monaco died exactly 10 years later – on the 26th of
          May, 1965.</li>
      </ul>

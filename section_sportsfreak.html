      <p>As you may know, China is a really big country with really big expectations. They want to be a world leader in many aspects of life, with no exclusion from sport. They finished at 3rd place in 2016 Summer Olympics’ medal table, only losing to UK (however China earned more medals than them) and USA. They are currently hegemon in table tennis, diving and weightlifting. China is also really successful in badminton, women’s volleyball and martial arts.</p>
      <p>Does it satisfy them? Absolutely no.</p>
      <p>Chinese president, Xi Jinping - big fan of football, announced that China wants to organize and win World Cup by the year of 2050. He doesn’t waste words, government’s special program contains many points, such as including football as a school subject (minimum of 3 hours per week), creating amateur football leagues, engaging coaches from Europe and South America. Their goal is to build around 70 000 new pitches and to have 50 million of young players in 2020.</p>
      <p>They also want to increase the interest in their domestic league. Chinese clubs, with a support of government, are offering enormous amount of money both for club and for players in order to sign them.</p>
      <blockquote>
      "I’m tired of football, I’m tired of people working in football industry. Everything is about money, that’s not my style"
      <footer>− Carlos Tevez in 2010<footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Do you wonder why I put this quote here? Well, Carlos Tevez, Argentinean striker signed a 2-year contract with Chinese club, Shanghai Shenghua, last summer. It is reported that he’s earning now around 4800€. Per hour. He earns 42 million of € per year which means his salary is the biggest one in whole football. Tevez himself said that isn’t true and he’s earning „less than legends”.</p>
      <p>What makes things even more hilarious? A year before, back in 2015 he asked Juventus, his club, to let him go one year before his contract expires, so he could join his childhood club, Boca Juniors. They allowed him to do so.</p>
      <p>What shows that they’re speeding up? Back in February 2015, Chinese club Hebei China Fortune bought Miroslav Radović, Legia Warsaw player, for 2 milions. In January 2016 this club bought AS Roma player, Gervinho, for 18 milions.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, confirmed that Real Madrid received an offer for CR7 from one of the Chinese clubs. According to him, the fee was 300 million €, while Cristiano would get 100 million for playing there. It shows that Chinese club want the biggest names to play for them. The thing is that the biggest names don’t want to play for them. Matter of time? Perhaps.
Europeans competitions are still way more prestigious and unless Chinese league gets a spot in Champions League, it’s not likely big stars join Chinese clubs.</p>

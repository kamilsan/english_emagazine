      <h1>Different method – but better?</h1>
      <p>Have you ever noticed that Americans like to be different from Europeans? For example they don’t use International System of Units (SI) because they prefer (awful  in my opinion) Imperial System.</p>
      <p>The same  goes in sports – they use the name ‘soccer’ (ugh!) because the name ‘football’ is restricted to American football. Moreover, their league system is different than European.</p>
      <p>No matter if it’s NBA (basketball league), NHL (hockey) or MLB (baseball), the system looks similar whereas NFL (American football) system is more like the UEFA Champions League system.</p>
      <p>I’ll briefly describe the NBA one for you.</p>
      <p>First of all, 30 teams are divided into two conferences – East and West, based mostly on a geographical location.</p>
      <p>The first part of the season is called ‘regular season’ – teams play 82 games, most of them with the others from their conference.</p>
      <p>Top 8 of each conference is promoted to the playoffs. The seeding is based on the results of the regular season. 1st team plays against the 8th, 2nd with 7th etc. – there is no draw, as in Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Finals is the last round, where the champion of West comes up against the champion of East.</p>
      <p>Most importantly the playoffs’ battles are not just the single games. They’re played in best-of-seven system which means that the team has to win 4 matches in order to get promoted into the next round.</p>
      <p>This method of arranging the knock-out stage certainly is less random than drawing each round but the surprises still do occur – 8th seeded teams eliminated 1st seeded ones 5 times. In 1999 New York Knicks (8th seeded team in the East) even got into the NBA Finals!</p>

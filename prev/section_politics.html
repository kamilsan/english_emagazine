        During holidays we could observe big changes in Polish political scene.
        Government decided that they wanted to get rid of post-PRL’s judges, who are
        mostly placed in high ranks of judiciary system. They had written 3 new laws
        and tried to push them through Parliament. Opposition immediately started
        protests and national campaign, in order to stop those laws. Despite this, the
        government didn’t want to abandon their laws, which was a part of great
        campaign of decommunization, and started opposite campaign in television and
        Internet, praising current government and spreading hate against judges and
        opposition. But what was the problem? New laws were declining the power of
        Highest Court, giving the whole power to Attorney General, who is nominated
        by the Prime Minister. And here we have a simple conclusion, that if the reform
        of judiciary system became official, we would destroy the rule of tripartite
        division of power, and this situation could open a wide way to many abuses.
        Moreover, European Parliament denounced our government’s decision about
        reforming judiciary system, as well as many of law doctors. That’s why
        president Andrzej Duda used veto law and sent two out of three projects of laws
        to reconsideration. Both opposition and government politicians were shocked.
        Media loyal to the <i>PiS</i> immediately started the campaign against the president,
        and many of politicians criticized his decision, especially Zbigniew Ziobro, the
        minister of justice and the Attorney General at the same time. President also
        announced that he will prepare his version of laws and present it in September.
        Now, we have a status quo between opposition, government and president, and
        after presidential presentation we will be able to recognize which side of conflict
        is right. In the meantime, we have a very interesting situation, in which the
        president stands against his mother-party, and is successful in it. It’s also a sign,
        that he has a slightly different vision of Poland then the ruling party. In our
        reality, where duopoly of <i>PO</i> and <i>PiS</i> is concreted, new fresh party can do really
        good job, balancing between left and right side. Andrzej Duda since the
        beginning of his presidency has maintained good relations with politics from
        <i>Kukiz’15</i>, who are more modern and flexible then <i>PiS’s</i> members, yet still
        contain traditionalism in their postulates. Now, we can only wait and observe. In
        a few days we should get information about president’s project and rewritten
        reforms made by government. Stay tuned.

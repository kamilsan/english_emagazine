      <h1>Louisa Johnson</h1>
      <p>
        Louisa Johnson is a 19-year old singer from the UK. She won the first place in British X-Factor in
        2015 and soon she became really well-known and reckognizable artist is the UK. She was born in
        Essex, UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world heard about Louisa when she performed song called <i>„Tears”</i> with Clean Bandit. It was
        played on every radiostation, so you must have heard it at least once. Then door to fame opened
        for Louisa and she took her life in her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Louisa's first single was called <i>„So Good”</i> and it is literally so good! Her voice is very unique and
        live she sounds even better than on the Internet, on YouTube. She won X-Factor's 2015 edition at
        the age of 17 which was shocking for British audience but soon they noticed that she has got an
        open way to success and she is very likely to achieve something big in the future. Also, she is the
        programme's youngest winner so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        In December 2016 Louisa performed in front of 16,000 people in the O2 during Jingle Bell Ball
        festival. I had a pleasure of seeing her from the front row which was completely unforgettable and
        stunning. She even sat down on a stage in front of me and sang her version of <i>„Love Yourself”</i>
        which is originally Justin Bieber's song. I'm sure that this year will belong to her. Louisa isn't
        known anywhere else than in England but in a few years time she will be a massive artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2017 Louisa dropped new single called <i>„Best Behaviour”</i> and soon it became the most
        played song according to Capital FM Radiostation which promotes Louisa.
        Louisa's debut album will probably be released later this year. Probably it won't be available here
        in Poland, but we've got Internet access so there's no need to worry about it.
        I present you few links to her songs. Audio versions and also live ones. Enjoy :)

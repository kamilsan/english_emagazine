      <p>When a football fan thinks of a great comeback, some matches come to his mind – Manchester United with two goals in added time leading to 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich in Champions League final in 1999, Liverpool coming from 0-3 deficit at half-time to win on penalties against AC Milan due to famous „Dudek dance” in CL final in 2005.</p>
      <p>This year Barcelona made their contribution to history of football.</p>
      <h2>1st match, 14th of February, Parc des Princes</h2>
      <p>PSG absolutely destroyed Barcelona. Barcelona’s midfield didn’t exist. Literally all 50/50 challenges were won by PSG players. Hopeless match, 4-0 (Di Maria’s brace, one goal by Draxler and Cavani) loss, no away goals (they are crucial when aggregate result is equal). Chances of advancement into the round for Barcelona? 0% – that is UEFA prediction.</p>

      <p>Impossible does not exist.</p>
      <h2>2nd match, 8th of March, Camp Nou</h2>
      <p>Refurbished Barҫa (playing in 3-4-3 instead of traditional 4-3-3) starts the game with a quick goal by Luis Suarez in 3’, 40th minute  – Iniesta tries backheel pass across the goal, luckily for Blaugrana the ball is deflected by Kurzawa, own goal, 2-0. Half-time. Hope increases.</p>
      <p>49’ – Neymar runs into penalty box, Meunier slides, Neymar stumbles over Meunier’s head, at first referee decides not to give a penalty for the foul, but after the consultation with the assistant he changes his mind. Messi steps up for penalty, it’s 3-0. 62nd minute, Kurzawa heads the ball towards Cavani, he smashes the ball with the outside of his foot, under the crossbar, 3-1, looks like game over.</p>
      <p>5 minutes + added time to go while scoring 3 goals is required to advance? Let’s see.</p>
      <p>88’ Neymar goes for a free kick, top bins, 4-1. 90th minute – Suarez dives and is fouled at the same time, another controversy but Deniz Aytekin decides to give a penalty. Neymar steps up and it is 5-1. 95th minute – Neymar’s desperate cross, Sergi Roberto taps the ball. 6-1. Barça goes into the quarter-final.</p>
      <p>Ecstasy.</p>

      <p>
        The Landfall Games is a small game development company not even close to being as popular as Rockstar Games or CD Projekt RED, but they are definitely unique. There is almost no plot in their games, they do not have the best graphics and they are pretty short. But the one thing, which makes this company’s games so extraordinary is their game play. The game ideas which were not already together with great game play gives you their products.
        They haven't created many games, but each of them looks good. For example the latest one which was supposed to be an April Fools prank, but came out to be one of the funniest games I've ever played. This game is called <i>Totally Accurate Battle Zombielator</i>. Kind of stupid and childish title, but the game is not so bad. It's a first person shooter with multiplayer and zombies. I know what you will say. Sth like "OMG this is such a cliché game, because there are thousands of games like this", and you'd be right. But I want to remind you, that it was a "Prank Game" created in a few weeks. Their most popular games are <i>TABS</i> and <i>Cluster Track</i>. They are pretty popular and definitely very funny. But still, the <i>TABZ</i> game is so far my favourite. The funny design of the ragdolls and multiplayer option (pretty good, as for a few weeks game) are really cool, so it is worth giving it a try.

      <p>This is that kind of movie, that when you start watching it you just want to turn it off, and you ask yourself where the idea of even starting it came from. But if you just manage to watch it for about 15 minutes, you won't be able to stop. The plot is weird but there are a lot of funny scenes, though. The movie tells a story about Hitler coming back to life (not in a zombie, horror/fantsy way) and without any idea where he is, he is just trying to understand the present world and how it works. This movie is very interesting. There are many people in this movie, who are not actors, but just some kind of tourists or passersbys, whose reactions are as real as humanly possible. In this movie Hitler ones again tries to convince people to the righteousness of his believes. The funniest part is, that most of the things which he is saying are very real, so this movie is not just another "z" class movie but it really makes you think about a lot of different things. But all in all, it's a really good movie to watch with almost anybody. It is not complicated and it is definitely worth watching.</p>

        Most of you have heard about games which are nearly impossible to win. And definitely
        without destroying at least one of your computer gears. These are for example:
        The <i>Souls</i> series, <i>Super Meat Boy</i> or the (so called) <i>"The World Hardest game"</i>, which
        many of you have probably played in your adolescent years. Some of them were
        complicated, some were annoying, but <i>I wanna be the Boshy</i> is a compilation of
        all of them. Some may say that it's just another plat former, but most games were
        created to get players interested or just let them have fun. This game is
        a challenge. It's annoying, the so called "checkpoints" are an important parts of a game,
        because if you activate one at the wrong time, you may have to replay the whole level.
        So if you want to have a relaxing, chill game, you better wait for the next monthâ€™s
        <i>Movie and Games 4 Every1</i>, because this game will make you suffer and after playing it,
        you will probably have to buy yourself a new keyboard. (A quick hint: Your mouse can also
        kill you in this game, so be careful). Oh, and this game is 32play, so you can easily
        download it from the internet.

      <h1>Movie: Arrival</h1>

        <i>Arrival</i> is a science-fiction movie about some unidentified flying
        objects that suddenly appeared on earth in different locations.
        Sounds like nothing special, just another sci-fi movie about
        aliens trying to destroy the earth. Well.. not really. The plot
        tells a story of an university teacher, who was given a job
        to translate aliens language. After many trials and errors
        she finally manages to understand them, and that's when the fun part begins.
        I don't want to make a spoiler, but there are many things happening
        which will definitely frustrate you. It's a kind of movie that makes you think
        and predict what is going to happen, and after all your efforts, it gives you
        unexpected answers. Not much action but it's definitely worth watching.

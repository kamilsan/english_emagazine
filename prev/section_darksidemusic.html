        These days there are many people who claim that modern music is deprived of any message whatsoever. Although at first glance, it seems that today’s mainstream popstars focus only on delivering melodic hits with catchy hooks, remember that it is not the case for everyone.
        One of those unique artists is a well-known American rapper, who performs under the stage name <i>Logic</i>. The artist - Bobby Tarantino has recently released his third studio album - <i>“Everybody”</i>.
        Throughout the whole project Logic speaks the truth concerning problems of today’s world. I must admit that every single track was on a solid musical level, however the one which stood out the most, and the one which caught my attention, and made me re-evaluate some things, was definitely the third single called <i>“1-800-273-8255”</i>.
        Assisted by Alessia Cara and Khalid, <i>Logic</i> puts out the meaningful message. He uses the song as a platform to bring people’s attention to topics the mainstream media does not want to bring up – mental health, anxiety, suicide, depression and so much more.
        The title is the phone number for the <i>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</i> in the USA, and the song itself is an anthem that shares a story of an individual in crisis who finds help, and encourages his fans and other individuals to contact somebody and ask for help. Logic approaches the song as a progression, starting from the suicidal perspective, encouraging the suicidal person to embrace life, and the suicidal person coming to the desire to live.
        All in all, <i>Logic</i> did an amazing job and created one of the most uplifting and comforting rap pieces of the new hip hop era. If you have not heard it yet, I encourage you to watch his latest VMAs performance and witness the real power of music.

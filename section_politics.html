      <p>Did you sometimes think, why exactly you are voting for „that” party during election? Have you ever sit down and read what are the main objectives of your politicians? Well, if you haven’t, you don’t have to worry about this, because majority of people won’t do it either. But, is this a good behavior? Let’s think about it.</p>
      <p>Looking at political parties in Poland, we can single out a few types of them. First of all, we have conservative parties, such as <i>Prawo i Sprawiedliwość</i> or <i>Kukiz’15</i>, which are conservative in their decent ideas, and are really close to Catholic Church. Next, we have liberals, which are parties like <i>.Nowoczesna</i>, <i>Platforma Obywatelska</i> or <i>Razem</i>. These parties are more into LGBTQ rights, problems of minorities and women rights. And for polish political scene, I have to say that this is all we have right now. And why this situation is really bad and needs to be changed as soon as possible? The answer is not that easy.</p>
      <p>First of all, we do not really have parties which could be categorized as right wing parties. You can say: “Hey, but <i>PiS</i> is actually right wing party!”. No, they aren’t right wing. They are conservatives, but their economy ideology is one big social add-on. Their idea of polish economy is to make as much taxes as possible, while giving to the people a small amount of them back, as (mentioned before) social add-ons. But economy is not everything. Their idea for society is to build a religious country, with Catholicism as state religion, where religious law is the same with state law, where every aspect of life is socialized. What is more worrying, a lot other parties (<i>Kukiz’15</i>, <i>Ruch Narodowy</i>, etc.) are strongly supporting this ideas.
         On the other hand, we have parties like <i>PO</i> and <i>Razem</i>, which are ruled by socialists, and their political ideas are also strongly connected with socialism. But, unlike conservative parties, this one are much more liberal. They are (as I mentioned before) for rights of minorities, gay marriage, etc. They are also strong supporters of EU. These days, <i>PO</i> is turning into right wing, while <i>Razem</i> is a specific party, and they postulates are close to radical socialism and communism. They are demanding full control of society, higher taxes for rich people and more rights for minorities.
         There are also other parties in polish political reality, but their real influence on government is yet too small. These parties are, for example, <i>Wolność</i>, which is a party ruled by Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who is one of the oldest politicians in Poland, and yet, one of the most controversial. This party is closest to right wing economy ideology, but in the same time they are very conservative and are against most of liberal reforms.</p>
      <p>Worst thing in our political scene is, that we have lack of variety. Again, you can say that we have a lot parties with different ideologies. Yes, but all of them are social parties, and their main goal is to get into government, but not for country’s good, but for their own greediness. We had <i>PO</i> in the government for 8 years, and amount of swindles was overwhelming. Now, when <i>PiS</i> got into rule, he is focused on fighting with his political enemies, rather then improving country. As we know from the history, socialism is great for getting into rule, but it doesn’t work for a long time. Polish problem is, that our society is more likely to get into social ideas, rather then working on our own. Good example is program called 500+. How it works? Well, each family, which has more then 1 child, get 500 zloty for each child, but not for the first one. Why is this bad? Because for each 500 zloty government is giving you, you have to pay in taxes 700 zloty. It's not worth for people. Who knows what’s better for you? You or the government? Answer it by yourself. The only one party, which has any chance to rule, which economical program is more right wing is <i>.Nowoczesna</i>, but for a few months they are also becoming socialized. That’s because, as I mentioned, we do not want to make decisions on our own, we prefer to let rulers do it for us.
         What’s the point of this article? I wanted to show you, that voting, and what’s more important, analyzing programs of political parties is one of the most important things in your adult life. If you don’t go for a voting, and then you are complaining about decisions made my government, you should ask yourself “what did I do to prevent this decisions?”</p>

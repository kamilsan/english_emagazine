      <h1>Outbreak in the coalition camp?</h1>
      <p>
        As you remember, last time I was writing about Presidents vetos. By the time this case was solved, new problem appeared in <i>United Right Wing</i> (pl. <i>Zjednoczona Prawica</i>). President Andrzej Duda started the skirmish with minister of national defence, Antoni Macierewicz. The base of conflict is set in competencies on who should be the head of military forces in Poland. According to our constitution, the main military leader is the president, but Antoni Macierewicz is very unsatisfied with this, and is trying to change this situation to more advantageous for him. He is trying to reduce presidential impact in Polish army, while at the same time he is building his own wing in the army structures, discharging generals and placing his own men on their places. The problem is however, that the president is not happy about this unfortunate turn of events, and started the campaign, which main goal is to discharge Antoni Macierewicz from his position. They are both very well-known, but while the president’s name is being associated with loads of positive things and actions, Macierewicz is known for his radical political views, strange obsession about Russia and, according to medias, for his alleged insanity.

        While I’m writing it, the conflict is more like cold war, where both sides are tightening their muscles, waiting for the opponent’s next move. Few days ago, the president made a step to provoke Macierewicz, calling his methods of „clearing” the generals and comparing it to communists’ methods. Right wing journalists started attacking president for his words, defending Macierewicz, while Macierewicz himself didn’t do anything. This problem is even more serious, because their conflict is based on army, the thing that is supposed to defend us. While Territorial defence forces are being formed, situation in Ukraine is not going to calm down, we need a clear and straight army structure. As long as this conflict is on, we cannot feel safe. The only thing which is confusing, is that Jarosław Kaczyński has not sided himself yet. He doesn’t want to leave his old friend Macierewicz alone, while at the same time he can’t  afford loosing president’s support. Right now, we are waiting, as always, for what is going to happen. I’m not a  fortune teller, but I think, that this whole case is going to come to its end at the end of the year. As I said before, stay tuned, because if you are not interested in politics, you can be sure that you will never have impact on what is going on in our country. If you have any idea of what should be the next topic, feel free to say it to me at school, or send it to me by my email. I’m waiting for your ideas!

      <h1>Game: Half-Life</h1>
      <p>As probably the most popular first person shooter in the world, <i>Half Life</i> part one was a disappointment for me. I know this game as much as most of the students of our school, but it was not the game play or graphic that made me not like it. The graphics as for an eighteen-year-old game are really good and the game developers have done a pretty good job when it comes to level designs and bosses, but the worst part for me was the plot. And don’t get me wrong here, the idea of the other universe filled with weird monsters and weapons was great, but the fact that as the main character Gordon Freeman you had to do all the work from saving the people to killing a giant baby like alien, it just didn’t make sense. If the character could at least speak it would be great. In contrast to game like Portal, where all you had to do was to finish the puzzle maps, the speaking wasn’t needed, because all other characters were machines and you didn’t have to make any conversations with them, but in this kind of game, where our hero had to speak with dozens of other characters, it would be great if he could at least reply.</p>
      <p>But after all it was not such a horrible game and I finished it without complaining. The second part is probably much better and I hope to play it soon.</p>
      <h1>Movie: Cabin in the Woods</h1>
      <p><i>Cabin in the Woods</i> is a horror movie filled with humour and making fun of all clichés that appear in other horror films. It begins like all scary movies. A group of friends go on a vacation to an old abandoned house in the middle of the forest. They are having a really good time when suddenly out of nowhere a group of monsters attack them. Some of them die, some survive and after a while the funny part starts. This film is more like a parody of all other horror movies and it’s really good. The director of <i>“Cabin in the Woods”</i> really understands how frustrating and annoying it is to see the main characters splitting up when a group of zombies try to kill you, or when they find an old and scary looking book which clearly nobody should ever read out loud and they don’t give a damn about that. It’s funny, not too long and has a closed ending so it won’t leave you unsatisfied. A perfect movie to watch with a group of friends at a party.</p>

      <h1>Walking on water</h1>
      <p>
        In our commercialised world there has always been a tendency to idealise superstars and celebrities
        treating them in such a way as if they were flawless. We, as common people,
        tend to think that our role models and idols don’t have to face any problems at all
        and simply lead a lavish lifestyle. In reality it is quite the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Eminem</i> in his newest single called <i>‘Walk on Water’</i> touches on that matter showing that artists like him
        aren’t gods despite our reverence to them. Em admits he has limits, doubts and insecurities too.
        Throughout each verse he states that he is not even comparable to the idealized figure people think he is.

        With so much success and so many achievements it won’t come as a surprise,
        that he feels the pressure to live up to the expectations.
        Eminem knows that no matter what new tracks he puts out, he will face criticism – he can’t accept that
        so easily, for him it is ‘a hard pill to swallow’.
        In one of his recent interviews with Malcolm Gladwell Em actually spoke about that particular concern:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        When you start out in your career, you have a blank canvas,
        so you can paint anywhere that you want because the thing ain’t been painted on yet.
        And then your second album comes out, and you paint a little more, and you paint a little more.
        By the time you get to your seventh and eighth album, (…) there’s nowhere else to paint.
        (…) And people are always expecting something different from you.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The last post-chorus sung by <i>Beyonce</i> ideally sums everything up – both her and <i>Eminem</i> have done
        many mistakes in their lives, which shows, that they are just as we are – they are not perfect
        and simply don’t want to be put on pedestal.

      <h1>Soul at its finest – Donald Glover</h1>
      <p>
        Donald Glover, who performs under the stage name <i>Childish Gambino</i> is an American actor, writer, producer, director, comedian, rapper and songwriter all combined. This time however the one-man band himself expands his horizons even further by releasing the highly anticipated third album called <i>“Awaken, My Love!”</i>. What stands out the most is the fact, that Glover has drastically changed his style. Even though he is most known for his ability to create slick rap with large amount of punchlines and worldplay, he does not hesitate to go on a significantly distinct journey.

        By listening to the album you can clearly notice, that Gambino has soul in his blood, despite the fact, that it was previously covered by overused stylistic devices and overwhelming lyrical structures. Glover leaves that behind, shows his feelings and above all opens onto listeners so much, that I would even risk a statement, that the whole project is almost like a life form.

        The radical change shocks at first, however the more you listen the more you appreciate the craftsmanship and his dedication. What is also worth mentioning is the way Glover uses and modulates his voice. He excels at it so much, that it creates the impression as if the project featured many guests, whereas in reality there aren’t any. He can scream (<i>“Boogieman”</i>), shout (<i>“Riot”</i>) or even whisper fondly (<i>“Redbone”</i>) and all the time he makes it sound brilliant.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all  I can certainly say, that this album is on whole another musical level. The lyrics, the voice, the emotions and finally the truth – everything is on point. So if you haven’t checked it out yet I highly advice you to do so and I guarantee, that you won’t regret it.
